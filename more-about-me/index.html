    <h1>More about me</h1>
    <p>
      As a student at Notre Dame, outside of the classroom, I'm involved with
      the men's water polo team as well as the club swimming team. I also enjoy
      spending time with friends, going to the football games, and trying new
      foods. Before Notre Dame, I grew up in Monmouth County, New Jersey and
      attended school at Christian Brother's academy in Lincroft.
